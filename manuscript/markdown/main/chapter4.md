Coming at the security problem from a penetration testers point of view can be quite different than coming at it from a software developers point of view.

* The penetration tester is trying to find all the faults in your system. This is not limited to the technology aspect either, as we address throughout this book.
* As the web developer, you are more focussed on delivering a solution that makes a problem less of a problem. Often not thinking so much about what could go wrong, but more focused on how to make it work.

In saying that, the two disciplines can work in harmony together. There is a real need for improving most software developers security related awareness, skills and knowledge, and as this book is focussed on the web developer, it is my intention to show you as a web developer, how to take the lessons learnt from the penetration testers perspective and apply it to your own work and life. I have the advantage of working in both disciplines and also in some very successful Scrum teams often as Scrum Master. This makes it relatively easy to empathise to both sides and pull the best from both sides, then apply it to the other side.

In this chapter I am going to detail a common work-flow of a penetration tester. Then apply the relevant parts for a web developer to a work-flow for you.

### Vulnerability Scanning

### Vulnerability Searching

_Todo_ This is actually in chapter 1 under bob the builder. Remove from here and add.

   Offensive Security's Exploit Database https://www.exploit-db.com/
      and their searchsploit tool: https://github.com/offensive-security/exploit-database/blob/master/searchsploit
   Security Fucus www.securityfocus.com/bid
   Querying Metasploit

### Exploitation

During this stage, thinking about and recording countermeasures for the vulnerabilities you are able to exploit successfully is just as important as finding and recording the exploited vulnerabilities.

## Agile Development Taking Back the Security Focus

If I can encourage even one developer within each team to lead the charge on taking back the responsibility of creating solutions that will withstand the types of cyber attacks that are being launched against our products and people on a regular basis today, I think we may be able to move forward and make our industry a better place, a place we want to be part of.

Primarily this process is about significantly reducing the cost of producing quality products.

The 10,000' View should be carried out each Sprint for each PBI as it is pulled into WIP. If the particular PBI has something of Physical, IoT, Mobile, People, Cloud, VPS, Network, Web Applications attributes, then you can apply the concepts and direction discussed in these chapters to the PBI you are working on.

It is not my intention to encourage you to think about nothing but security, because then you would not deliver a product, but rather for it to become part of who you are, so as part of your normal work-flow the security consciousness and habits you build will be firmly entrenched. Thus your deliverables will be no longer at the bottom of the tree where the attackers pick from first.


_Todo_

Create hypothetical process that augments an agile workflow. Many of these concepts will come from the Web Applications chapter with pieces from the other chapters. Lean heavily on my own experience here of what has and has not worked well in the past and where I see things going.
