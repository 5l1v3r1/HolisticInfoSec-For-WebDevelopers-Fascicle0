# 3. Tooling Setup {#tooling-setup}

At this stage, all the software tools I use for penetration and security testing are free and most are also open source (other than Windows of course). I always try hard to stick to this, as it makes:

1. Pitching tooling acquisition to managers and those that hold the purse strings easy
2. Learning how the tools work and contributing to the security ecosystem

## Kali Linux {#tooling-setup-kali-linux}

In the words of Offensive Security (Creators of Kali Linux), [Kali Linux](http://docs.kali.org/introduction/what-is-kali-linux) is an advanced Penetration Testing and Security Auditing Linux distribution. For those that are familiar with BackTrack, basically Kali is a new creation based on Debian rather than Ubuntu, with significant improvements over BackTrack.

Offensive Security Kali Linux is free and always will be. It is also completely open (as it is based on Debian) to modification of its OS or programmes.  
FHS compliant. That means the file system complies to the Linux File-system Hierarchy Standard.  
Wireless device support is vast. Including USB devices.  
Forensics Mode. As with BackTrack 5, the Kali ISO also has an option to boot into the forensic mode. No drives are written to (including swap). No drives will be auto mounted upon insertion.

Some of the following recommendations have come from my [blog post](http://blog.binarymist.net/2014/03/29/up-and-running-with-kali-linux-and-friends/) that was originally used for a PenTest Magazine article.

When it comes to actually getting Kali on some hardware, there is a multitude of options available.

All externally listening services by default are disabled, but very easy to turn on if/when required. The idea being to reduce chances of detecting the presence of Kali.

Kali also provides a simple way to create your own ISO image from the latest source. You can include the packages you want and exclude the ones you do not. You can customise the kernel. The options are virtually limitless.

The default desktop environment in Kali 2.0 is Gnome3, but Kali also provides an easy way to configure which desktop environment you use.

The alternative options provided are: KDE, LXDE, XFCE, I3WM and MATE.

Kali has really embraced the Debian ethos of being able to be run on pretty well any hardware with extreme flexibility. This is great to see.

### What's Included in Kali Linux {#tooling-setup-kali-linux-whats-included-in-kali-linux}

More than 300 security programmes packaged with the operating system. Before installation you can view the tools included in the [Kali repository](http://git.kali.org/gitweb/), or once installed by issuing the following command:

{linenos=off}
    # prints complete list of installed packages.
    dpkg --get-selections | less

To find out a little more about the application:

`dpkg-query -l '*<some text you think may exist in the package name>*'`

Or if you know the package name you're after:

`dpkg -l [package name]`

Want more info still?

`man [package name]`

### Kali Linux Install {#tooling-setup-kali-linux-kali-linux-install}

Offensive Security (the creators of Kali Linux) provide many options for running their distribution. ISO, turn-key [VMware or VirtualBox](https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-vmware-virtualbox-image-download/) image, [custom ARM images](https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-vmware-arm-image-download/), Mobile images ([NetHunter](https://www.kali.org/kali-linux-nethunter/)).
I have used the ISO installed on a VM guest in this set-up, as I had a capable host for running this VM and the Windows VM that I often set-up also. I didn't want the pre-generated SSH host key, which is why I chose the ISO over the turn-key image. For some of the dangers of using an install with pre-generated SSH host key, check-out Nilesh Kapoor's talk at OWASP NZ Day 2016 on [Host Hardening](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_New_Zealand_Day_2016#tab=Presentation_Schedule). Slide 12 details how to regenerate the SSH keychain. If you install on physical hardware, you can just skip this section and move to the "[Tools I Use](#tooling-setup-kali-linux-tools-i-use-that-need-adding-to-kali-linux)" section.

The Offensive Security team which can be found on [IRC](http://docs.kali.org/community/kali-linux-irc-channel) are also very helpful and quick to respond to package requests, etc.

You should find most of what you need at [kali category installation](http://docs.kali.org/category/installation). Just follow the links specific to your requirements.

For this install I created a new VirtualBox VM based on Debian 64.  
Made a dynamically allocated VDI disk of size 45GB and 4GB RAM. More RAM is helpful sometimes, but in most cases I've found 4GB to be enough. You could also increase the size of the disk if you want to. 50GB would give a little more breathing room. Especially if you have additional tools or password lists. With this install I end up with 24.2 GB used.

The following are just preference, you can play with these as you like.  
Once the machine is created, I go into the settings and change the location of Snapshots to be stored with the VM which is running on its own SSD.  
Change the Shared Clipboard and Drag'n'Drop to Bidirectional.  
Change Processors to use as many cores as you can without affecting the rest of your system and any other VMs running on it.  
Increase the Video Memory to at least 64MB.  
I usually like to add a shared folder to easily copy files from host <-> guest. Do not forget to add your user to the vboxsf group that VirtualBox Guest Additions Installer creates below.  

Setup network host adapters. This is also discussed in the [NodeGoat Set-up on your local machine](#process-agile-development-and-practices-security-regression-testing-nodegoat-set-up-on-your-local-machine) section in the Process and Practises chapter:

Host-only Adapter allows:

1. The VM to talk to the host and other VMs connected to the host
2. The host to talk to guest VMs  
(often useful for the likes of demoing OWASP Zap Api where you may have Zap running on Kali and a vulnerable web app running on another VM or your physical hardware)  

NAT networking allows the VM to talk to the internet via the hosts network interface.

Both Host-only and Nat networking are invisible from outside of the host.

On your physical host, you could set-up your NAT adapter like the following:

![](images/PhysicalNatNetwork.png)

{pagebreak}

and your Host-only adapter like:

![](images/PhysicalHostOnlyAdapterNetwork.png)

![](images/PhysicalHostOnlyDHCPNetwork.png)

{pagebreak}

On your Kali Linux VM, your NAT adapter like the following:

![](images/GuestNATAdapter.png)

{pagebreak}

and your Host-only adapter like :

![](images/GuestHostOnlyAdapter.png)

Then any time you need to be on the same network segment as the physical host, just switch the Host-only Adapter to Bridged Adapter.

The ISO can be downloaded from [kali downloads](https://www.kali.org/downloads/) via torrent and direct download. A little over 3GB.

you are going to want to check the validity of the ISO (or other image if that is your preference) by verifying the SHA1 checksums. Details are directly under the downloads section. This should be enough to get you going.

There are additional details if you want to read them at [http://docs.kali.org/introduction/download-official-kali-linux-images](http://docs.kali.org/introduction/download-official-kali-linux-images), but essentially there are several ways to validate that you have the official Kali Linux installer and not some tampered with binary. The details at the above link provide a bit more explanation around the validation steps and importing the Kali GPG public key. Right down the bottom of the page is the command for cryptographically validating the downloaded binary... once you have validated the downloaded `SHA1SUMS` file with the `SHA1SUMS.pgp` key that you also downloaded. You'll probably just have to change the actual `.iso` name in the command to that of the `.iso` you downloaded.

You can refer to the hard-disk install ([http://docs.kali.org/installation/kali-linux-hard-disk-install](http://docs.kali.org/installation/kali-linux-hard-disk-install)) for running through the OS installer if you need it. For Partitioning disks, I choose "Guided - use entire disk and set up LVM" for future flexibility.

Once installed, run the following and regularly thereafter. On the first dist-upgrade, this could take hours depending on how many updates there are:

{linenos=off}
    apt-get update
    apt-get dist-upgrade

[Install Guest Additions:](http://docs.kali.org/general-use/kali-linux-virtual-box-guest).

{linenos=off}
    apt-get update
    apt-get install -y virtualbox-guest-x11
    reboot

In Kali 2016.1 (Sana) the default user is no longer root. If your installing, make sure you use a decent password. Not a dictionary word or similar. It is generally a good idea to use a mix of upper case, lower case characters, numbers and special characters and of a decent length. You will get the option to set your password and create a root user or just use sudo during the install. If you want to change password later, then at the terminal, enter: `passwd` and follow the prompts. Many of the commands used in this book will require root privileges. Prefixing with `sudo` will elevate your privileges to those of root.

I usually set-up the `/etc/network/interfaces` file here for the host-only adapter, as we will need this working for the Process and Practises chapter at least, again this is partly discussed in the [NodeGoat Set-up on your local machine](#process-agile-development-and-practices-security-regression-testing-nodegoat-set-up-on-your-local-machine) section in the Process and Practises chapter. Backup your `/etc/network/interfaces` before making changes. Add the following to the bottom of the interfaces:

{linenos=off}
    #Host-only adapter
    allow-hotplug eth1
    iface eth1 inet static
    address 192.168.56.20
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    gateway 192.168.56.1

If you chose to use a shared folder during the install or if you want to set that up at any time. Now that the VirtualBox Guest Additions Installer has run and added the `vboxsf` group, you will need to add your user to that:

{linenos=off}
    sudo adduser $(whoami) vboxsf

I prefer the Mate desktop environment over the default. To set this up, run the following:

{linenos=off}
    apt-get install mate-core mate-desktop-environment-extra mate-desktop-environment-extras

Then at the login screen just click the gear icon and change to Mate.

### Tools I Use in Kali Linux requiring config, etc {#tooling-setup-kali-linux-tools-i-use-in-kali-linux-requiring-config-etc}

#### Metasploit {#tooling-setup-kali-linux-tools-i-use-in-kali-linux-config-etc-metasploit}

The Metasploit Community / Pro package is no longer shipping in Kali. Instead the metasploit-framework package is available. If you need the Community or Pro
edition, you will have to register your personal details with Rapid7 in order to be supplied with a license. There are more details at the kali.org site.

1. To start Metasploit, often I like to see which ports are open first. At the command prompt you can type:  
`ss -ant`
2. Then start postgresql if you require [database support](#additional-resources-using-the-database-and-workspaces-in-metasploit), which is generally quite useful:  
`service postgresql start`  
Followed by:  
`ss -ant`  
if you are interested in which ports have been opened. PostgreSQL should be listening on port 5432.  
You can also check the status of the service with:  
`service postgresql status`  
3. Initialise the Metasploit Framework database  
`msfdb init`  
This will create databases: `msf` and `msf_test`, and create a configuration file in  
`/usr/share/metasploit-framework/config/database.yml`  
4. To start Metasploit, we used to start the Metasploit service with:  
`service metasploit start`  
but now that there is no `metasploit` service as such, we instead just run:  
`msfconsole`  
or possibly with a resource script:  
`msfconsole -r <your custom resource>.rc`

##### Useful metasploit [commands](https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/msfconsole-commands/)

* `msf >` [help](https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/msfconsole-commands/#help)
* `msf >` [show](https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/msfconsole-commands/#show)
  * Valid options to add to show are: `all`, `encoders`, `nops`, `exploits`, `payloads`, `auxiliary`, `plugins`, `options`  
  * Additional module specific parameters are: `missing`, `advanced`, `evasion`, `targets`, `actions`  
* `msf > show options`

* [Information gathering](http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/information-gathering-using-metasploit/)

#### BeEF {#tooling-setup-kali-linux-tools-i-use-in-kali-linux-config-etc-beef}

Check-out the recommended [configuration](https://github.com/beefproject/beef/wiki/Configuration).

Modify the following two files as required:

1. `/etc/beef-xss/config.yaml`
2. `/usr/share/beef-xss/extensions/metasploit/config.yaml`

If you need Metasploit integration in BeEF (in most cases you will want this), set:  
`extension: metasploit: enable: true`  
in the `/etc/beef-xss/config.yaml` file.  
Also make sure:  
`enable`  
is set to `true` in `/usr/share/beef-xss/extensions/metasploit/config.yaml`

When running Metasploit for BeEF, I often provide `msfconsole` with a Metasploit resource file specifically for BeEF (I call this `beef.rc` and put it in `~/`). This resource file will have the following at least in it:

`load msgrpc ServerHost=127.0.0.1 Pass=abc123`

Start postgresql. Then metasploit like:

`msfconsole -r beef.rc`

If not using the resource file, then once `msfconsole` was running, in order to enable RPC communication for BeEF, I would enter:

`load msgrpc ServerHost=127.0.0.1 Pass=abc123`

Finally... starting BeEF. There are at least three ways. I find the first to be the most informative and interactive. Also do not forget to run beef as root.

* Contrary to a blog post on the [beefproject](http://blog.beefproject.com/2014/06/kali-formerly-backtrack-linux-beef.html), I've found the most useful way to run BeEF to be from the `/usr/share/beef-xss/` directory  
`./beef`  
This way provides the most feedback. If the main `config.yaml`  
(That resides in `/etc/beef-xss/config.yaml`) contains:  
`extension: console: shell: enable: true`  
then we also get an interactive [console](https://github.com/beefproject/beef/wiki/BeEF-Console), but no web UI by the look of it.
* The second way, running from the command line:  
`service beef-xss start`  
gives no feedback other than a return.
* The third way, running BeEF from the Kali menu:  
Menu: Exploitation Tools -> BeEF XSS Framework -> beef  
doesn't provide a lot of feedback as to what is loaded, and that is if you are running as root.

#### Updating BurpSuite

If you run Burp and it tells you that "A new version of Burp is available.", follow these directions:

1. Get the new version (it is a `.jar` file) from [https://portswigger.net/burp/download.html](https://portswigger.net/burp/download.html)
2. From `~/Downloads`
3. `mv burpsuite_[version].jar /usr/bin`
4. From `/usr/bin`
5. `mv burpsuite burpsuite-old`
6. `mv burpsuite_[version].jar burpsuite`
7. `chmod 755 burpsuite`
8. `chown root:root burpsuite`
9. Test Burp

### Tools I Use That Need Adding to Kali Linux {#tooling-setup-kali-linux-tools-i-use-that-need-adding-to-kali-linux}

I now take a backup in case I need to revert. With VirtualBox this is very easy to take a snap-shot that can be reverted to at any time. Snap-shots are excellent for returning to a known state between penetration tests. Testing is not really testing at all unless you can reproduce the same results each test. Starting from a known state is essential for this.

#### Terminator {#tooling-setup-kali-linux-tools-i-use-that-need-adding-to-kali-linux-terminator}

As I spend most of my life in terminals, I want a good one. I've found Terminator does everything I need from a terminal. Briefly discussed on my [blog](http://blog.binarymist.net/2013/01/19/a-decent-console-for-windows/) . If you also like a decent terminal experience, then:  
`apt-get install terminator`

#### [Discover Scripts](#process-and-practises-penetration-testing-reconnaissance-discover-scripts) {#tooling-setup-kali-linux-tools-i-use-that-need-adding-to-kali-linux-discover-scripts}

A set of shell scripts tied together in a CUI to aggregate Kali Linux information gathering tools & automate various penetration testing tasks. Both passive and active options allowing you to dig up a lot of dirt on your target long before you start trying to penetrate them. So rather than getting familiar with all the reconnaissance tools, you can just get familiar with Discover Scripts.

1. `git clone https://github.com/leebaird/discover.git /opt/discover/`
2. `cd /opt/discover/ && ./update.sh`

#### [SmbExec](https://github.com/pentestgeek/smbexec) {#tooling-setup-kali-linux-tools-i-use-that-need-adding-to-kali-linux-smbexec}

The process looks like the following in Kali 2016.1

1. `git clone https://github.com/pentestgeek/smbexec.git /opt/smbexec`
2. `cd /opt/smbexec && ./install.sh`
3. Select "1 - Debian/Ubuntu and derivatives"
4. [Enter] to agree to the install location of `/opt`  
You may also need to:
5. cd /opt/smbexec/progs
6. ln -s /usr/bin/pth-winexe smbwinexe  
# in Kali 1.1. the following link was not needed as smbexeclient already existed.
7. ln -s /usr/bin/pth-smbclient smbexeclient

%% Had discussion with Jonny via email about the links.

#### [Gitrob](https://github.com/michenriksen/gitrob)

Gitrob is an OSINT reconnaissance tool for obtaining information from your target that has a github account, or more.

1. `git clone https://github.com/michenriksen/gitrob.git /opt/gitrob`
2. `gem install bundler`
3. `apt-get install libpq-dev`
3. `service postgresql start`
4. `su postgres`
5. `createuser -s  gitrob  --pwprompt` # Do not use a password with [@](https://github.com/michenriksen/gitrob/issues/63) in it. 
6. `createdb -O gitrob gitrob`
7. `exit`
8. `cd /opt/gitrob/bin`
9. `gem install gitrob`

Now is where you need to get a [github API token](https://github.com/settings/tokens), because gitrob gets its OSINT from the [github API](https://developer.github.com/v3/)

Now you configure gitrob with the information we have just discussed. Running the following will prompt you for the details:

`gitrob configure`  
This will write to ~/.gitrobrc

To run:

`gitrob [repo1, repo2, etc] [usernames, ...]`  
or see the documentation for more details

%% Errors installing. Submitted issue here: https://github.com/michenriksen/gitrob/issues/62
%% Error running. Didn't like my password: https://github.com/michenriksen/gitrob/issues/63

#### [CMSmap](https://github.com/Dionach/CMSmap)

`git clone https://github.com/Dionach/CMSmap.git /opt/CMSmap`

#### [Veil Framework](https://www.veil-framework.com/) {#tooling-setup-kali-linux-tools-i-use-that-need-adding-to-kali-linux-veil-framework}

I decided to clone the Veil-Framework, as it has a good collection of very useful tools. Veil-Evasion is specifically useful for Anti Virus Evasion. The Veil super project which has an install script to install all of the projects can be found at the [Veil](https://github.com/Veil-Framework/Veil) repository of the Veil-Framework account on github.

There are install guides here:  
[https://www.veil-framework.com/guidesvideos/](https://www.veil-framework.com/guidesvideos/)

To install:

1. 
    {line-numbers=off}
       git clone https://github.com/Veil-Framework/Veil.git /opt/Veil
2. 
    {line-numbers=off}
       cd /opt/Veil && ./Install.sh -c  
  The dependency installs take a while. Python on Windows, Ruby and Go.
3. Select the defaults for the Python for Windows install.
4. When the install reaches the "Select Destination Directory", go with the default.
5. Click the "Yes" when asked if you want to overwrite the existing Python files.
6. Select the defaults for the rest of the Python install.
7. Next up is the pywin32 set-up. Click "Next" to continue.
8. Leaving the default Python directory location -> click "Next" -> "Next" -> "Finish"
9. Next up is pycrypto. "Next" -> "Next" -> "Next" -> "Finish"
10. Choose your language
11. Accept the Ruby License Agreement
12. "Install" -> "Yes" to Folder Exists -> "Finish"
13. Next is golang

to run Veil-Evasion:  
`cd /opt/Veil/Veil-Evasion/ && ./Veil-Evasion.py`

#### Password Lists {#tooling-setup-kali-linux-tools-i-use-that-need-adding-to-kali-linux-password-lists}

1. `mkdir ~/Desktop/password_list`
2. Download password lists:
  * Rockyou [https://downloads.skullsecurity.org/passwords/rockyou.txt.bz2](https://downloads.skullsecurity.org/passwords/rockyou.txt.bz2) 139.9 MB decompressed, 14344391 passwords. These came available from a social game and advertising website in 2009.
  * Crackstation. If you have the room, you can download the full list, otherwise the human only is a lot smaller, 716.4 MB decompressed. 63941069 passwords

    2. [http://download.g0tmi1k.com/wordlists/large/](http://download.g0tmi1k.com/wordlists/large/)
3. Decompress any that need it.

There are many other good lists out there. Also if you:  
`locate wordlists`  
on your Kali Linux install, you will find many already exist in Kali Linux.

#### Common User Passwords Profiler (cupp) {#tooling-setup-kali-linux-tools-i-use-that-need-adding-to-kali-linux-cupp}

Easy to use password profiling tool.

`git clone https://github.com/Mebus/cupp.git /opt/cupp`

#### [Http Screenshot](https://github.com/breenmachine/httpscreenshot) {#tooling-setup-kali-linux-tools-i-use-that-need-adding-to-kali-linux-httpscreenshot}

Useful for taking screen shots of a large number of websites concurrently.

1. `pip install selenium`
2. `git clone https://github.com/breenmachine/httpscreenshot.git /opt/httpscreenshot`
3. phantomjs is a requirement. This was installed when we installed Discover Scripts from above. Discover Scripts installs rawr and rawr installs phantomjs in `/opt/rawr/data/phantomjs/bin/phantomjs`, so we need to create a symlink:  
`ln -s /opt/rawr/data/phantomjs/bin/phantomjs /usr/bin/phantomjs`
4. `apt-get install swig libssl-dev python-dev python-pip`  
According to the installation directions, swig2.0 was required, although the relevant swig2.0 or swig3.0 is a dependency, so it doesn't need to be specified.
5. `cd /opt/httpscreenshot && pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. If you want to run `masshttp.sh`, edit the `/opt/httpscreenshot/masshttp.sh`
  * Make sure the path to the masscan binary is correct. `whereis masscan` will reveal its location. By default it will be in `/usr/bin/masscan`
  * Change the two locations that specify where httpscreenshot.py is from  
  `~/tools/httpscreenshot.py` to `/opt/httpscreenshot/httpscreenshot.py`
  * You can also add any extra ports you want to scan, `8080,8001` etc.
  * Create a networks.txt and add the cidr range you want to scan.
  * `cd /opt/httpscreenshot && ./masshttp.sh`
7. If you want to run `httpscreenshot.py` by itself, the simplest way:
  * `cd /opt/httpscreenshot && vim inputURLs`  
  Now add the URLs you want screen shots of and save.
  * Then run it:  
  `./httpscreenshot.py -l inputURLs -p -w 5 -a -vH`

#### BypassUAC {#tooling-setup-kali-linux-tools-i-use-that-need-adding-to-kali-linux-bypassuac}

Used to bypass UAC at post exploitation, allowing us to get the system account. Now I used this in the demo attack I walk through in the Website section under Spoofing of the Risks section in the Network chapter of [Fascicle 1](https://leanpub.com/holistic-infosec-for-web-developers-fascicle1-vps-network-cloud-webapplications). There is in fact a way that is less likely to trigger Anti Virus (AV). I cover this under the below set of directions.

In Kali 1.1

1. `cd /opt/`
2. `wget http://www.secmaniac.com/files/bypassuac.zip`
3. `unzip bypassuac.zip`
4. `cp bypassuac/bypassuac.rb /opt/metasploit/apps/pro/msf3/scripts/meterpreter/`
5. `mv bypassuac/uac/ /opt/metasploit/apps/pro/msf3/data/exploits/`

What usually happens with using the above script is that an executable is usually dropped on the target machine which also spawns a second file. Often AV will trigger from one of these two files. A better way and the way I now use is to use the `bypassuac_injection` module instead.

In Kali 2016.1 rolling

the demo attack mentioned above may look like the following:

{linenos=off}
    msf exploit(handler) >
    [*] Starting the payload handler...
    ...
    msf exploit(handler) > sessions -i 1
    [*] Starting interaction with 1...
    meterpreter > getsystem
    [-] priv_elevate_getsystem: Operation failed: The environment is incorrect.
    
    # If you can obtain an administrative account,  
    # usually it will be UAC that prevents getsystem from being successful.
    
    meterpreter > background
    [*] Backgrounding session 1...
    msf exploit(handler) > use exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_injection
    msf exploit(bypassuac_injection) > set target 1
    target => 1
    msf exploit(bypassuac_injection) set payload <your chosen payload>
    payload => <your chosen payload>
    msf exploit(bypassuac_injection) exploit
    ...

#### Chromium {#tooling-setup-kali-linux-tools-i-use-that-need-adding-to-kali-linux-chromium}

`sudo apt-get install chromium`

As a web developer I use the chromium dev tools more frequently than FireFox dev tools, although both have their strengths.

In Kali Linux 1.1:

In order to run this under the root account, you will need to add the following parameter to `/etc/chromium/default` between the quotes for `CHROMIUM_FLAGS=””`

`--user-data-dir`

In Kali 2016.1 rolling:

We no longer have to run everything as root, so this is no longer an issue.

#### Chromium Extensions {#tooling-setup-kali-linux-tools-i-use-that-need-adding-to-kali-linux-chromium-extensions}

##### FoxyProxy Standard {#tooling-setup-kali-linux-tools-i-use-that-need-adding-to-kali-linux-chromium-extensions-foxyproxy-standard}

Really reduces friction with web proxy interception. FoxyProxy is a very handy add-on for both Chromium and FireFox. Although it seems to have more options for FireFox, or at least they are more easily accessible. It allows you to set-up a list of proxies and then switch between them as you need.

FoxyProxy provides a menu button, so with two clicks you can disable the add-on completely to revert to your previous settings, or select any of your predefined proxies. This is a real time saver.

Once you add it to your browser, open it up and add a new proxy. We will use this one for Burpsuite later.

Proxy Name: Burp 8080 # or what ever you like.  
Host or IP Address: `127.0.0.1`  
Port: `8080`

##### SQL Inject Me

Simple and often useful for running a quick vulnerability assessment. Open source software (GPLv3) from Security Compass Labs. SQL Inject Me is a component of the Exploit-Me suite. Allowing you to test all or any number of input fields on all or any of a pages forms. You just fill in the fields with valid data, then test with all the tools attacks or with the top that you have defined in the options menu. It then looks for database errors which are rendered into the returned HTML as a result of sending escape strings, so does not cater for blind injection. You can also add remove escape strings and resulting error strings that SQL Inject Me should look for on response. The order in which each escape string can be tried can also be changed. All you need to know can be found [here](http://labs.securitycompass.com/exploit-me/sql-inject-me/sql-inject-me-faq/).

##### XSS Me

Simple and often useful for running a quick vulnerability assessment. Open source software (GPLv3) from Security Compass Labs. XSS Me is also a component of the Exploit-Me suite. This tools behaviour is very similar to SQL Inject Me (follows the Principle of Least Astonishment (POLA)) which makes using the tools very easy. Both these add-ons have next to no learning curve. The level of entry is very low and I think are exactly what web developers that make excuses for not testing their own security need. The other thing is that it helps developers understand how these attacks can be carried out. XSS Me currently only tests for reflected XSS. It does not attempt to compromise the security of the target system. Both XSS Me and SQL Inject Me are reconnaissance tools, where the information is the vulnerabilities found. XSS Me does not support stored XSS or user supplied data from sources such as cookies, links, or HTTP headers. How effective XSS Me is in finding vulnerabilities is also determined by the list of attack strings the tool has available. Out of the box the list of XSS attack strings are derived from RSnakes collection which were donated to OWASP who now maintains it as one of their [cheat-sheets](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_Filter_Evasion_Cheat_Sheet).. Multiple encodings are not yet supported, but are planned for the future. You can help to keep the collection up to date by submitting new attack strings.

### Additional Hardware


#### TP-LINK TL-WN722N USB Wireless Adapter

It is often very helpful to have at least a couple of Wi-Fi adapters when you are performing certain wireless reconnaissance or attacks or even so you can maintain internet connectivity using your phone as a wireless hot-spot while you are on another network. Useful for researching while your connected to a targets wireless Access Point (AP). An easy way to do this is to use the laptops on-board wireless interface to connect to the phones wireless hot-spot and pass the USB Wi-Fi adapter straight to the guest.

There are many devices of varying specifications. I've found (along with others) that the TL-WN722N hits a good sweet spot of cross platform compatibility, price, size, easy to find and a few other considerations.

As I find it flexible to run pen testing set-ups as VMs, that is what the following addresses. Using VirtualBox 5.0.4, USB devices have to be "passed through" to the guest. The following process explains what is involved.

The following is the process I found to set-up the pass-through on Kali 2016.1 (first Kali rolling release. Kernel 4.3, Gnome 3.18), by-passing the Linux Mint 17.3 (Rosa) Host (in my case).

##### Wi-Fi Adapter:

TP-LINK TL-WN722N Version 1.10

* chip-set: Atheros ar9271
* Vendor ID: 0cf3
* Product ID: 9271
* Module (driver): ath9k_htc

![](images/TL-WN722N.jpg)

##### Useful commands:

* `iwconfig`
* `ifconfig`
* `sudo lshw -C network`
* `iwlist scan`
* `lsusb`
* `dmesg | grep -e wlan -e ath9`
* contents of `/var/log/syslog`
* `lsmod`
* Release DHCP assigned IP. Similar to Windows ipconfig /release  
`dhclient -r [interface-name]``
* Renew DHCP assigned IP. Similar to Windows ipconfig /renew  
`dhclient [interface-name]`

##### Reconnaissance:

When you plug the Wi-Fi adapter into your laptop and run `lsusb`, you should see a line that looks like:

`ID 0cf3:9271 Atheros Communications, Inc. AR9271 802.11n`

The first four hex digits are the Vendor ID and the second four hex digits are the Product ID.

If you have a look from the bottom up of the `/var/log/syslog` file, you will see similar output to the following:

{title="/var/log/syslog", linenos=off, lang=bash}
    kernel: [ 98.212097] usb 2-2: USB disconnect, device number 3
    kernel: [ 102.654780] usb 1-1: new high-speed USB device number 2 using ehci_hcd
    kernel: [ 103.279004] usb 1-1: New USB device found, idVendor=0cf3, idProduct=7015
    kernel: [ 103.279014] usb 1-1: New USB device strings: Mfr=16, Product=32, SerialNumber=48
    kernel: [ 103.279020] usb 1-1: Product: UB95
    kernel: [ 103.279025] usb 1-1: Manufacturer: ATHEROS
    kernel: [ 103.279030] usb 1-1: SerialNumber: 12345
    kernel: [ 103.597849] usb 1-1: ath9k_htc: Transferred FW: htc_7010.fw, size: 72992
    kernel: [ 104.596310] ath9k_htc 1-1:1.0: ath9k_htc: Target is unresponsive
    kernel: [ 104.596328] Failed to initialize the device
    kernel: [ 104.605694] ath9k_htc: probe of 1-1:1.0 failed with error -22

##### Provide USB privileges to guest:

First of all you need to add the user that controls guest to the vboxusers group on the host so that VMs can control USB devices. logout/in of/to host.

##### Provide USB recognition to guest:

Install the particular VirtualBox Extension Pack on to the host. These packs can be found here ([https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)) for the most recent,  
and older builds here: ([https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds_5_0](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds_5_0)). Do not forget to checksum the pack before you add the extension. The version of the extension pack must match that of the VirtualBox installed. Now in your guest, check to see if you have the appropriate linux-headers package installed. If you do not, run the following:

1. `apt-get update`
2. `apt-get upgrade`
3. `apt-get dist-upgrade`
4. `apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)`
5. Shutdown Linux guest OS
6. Apply extension to VirtualBox in the host at: File -> Preferences -> Extensions

##### Blacklist Wi-Fi Module on Host:

Unload the `ath9k_htc` module to take effect immediately and blacklist it so that it does not load on boot. The module needs to be blacklisted on the host in order for the guest to be able to load it. Now we need to check to see if the module is currently loaded on the host with the following command:

`lsmod | grep -e ath`

We are looking for `ath9k_htc`. If it is visible in the output produced from the previous command, unload it with the following command:

`modprobe -r ath9k_htc`

Now you will need to create a blacklist file in `/etc/modprobe.d/`  
Create `/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-ath9k.conf` and add the following text into it and save:

`blacklist ath9k_htc`

I had to do the following step on Kali 1.1, but it seems it is no longer necessary in Kali 2016.1 rolling. If you are still on 1.1, go into the settings of your VM -> USB -> and add a Device Filter. I named this tl-wn722n and added the Vendor and Product ID’s we discovered with `lsusb`. Make sure The “Enable USB 2.0 (EHCI) Controller” is enabled also.

![](images/USBDeviceFilter.png)

%% ##### Upgrade Driver on Guest:

%% Start the VM.

%% Install the latest firmware-atheros package:

%% On the guest, check to see which version of firmware-atheros is installed:

%% `dpkg-query -l '*atheros*'`

%% Will probably be `0.44kali` whether you’re on Kali Linux 1.0.0 or 2.

%% `aptitude show firmware-atheros`

%% Will provide lots more information if you are interested. So now we need to remove this old package:

%% `apt-get remove --purge firmware-atheros`



%% Don't add any extra repositories to your install.
%% https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux/top-10-post-install-tips/



%% Add the jessie-backports (that’s Debian 8.0) repository to your `/etc/apt/sources.list` in the following form:

%% `deb http://ftp.nz.debian.org/debian jessie-backports main contrib non-free`

%% Change the country prefix to your country if you like and follow it up with an update:

%% `apt-get update`

%% Then install the later package from the new repository we just added:

%% `apt-get install -t jessie-backports firmware-atheros`

%% Now if you run the `dpkg-query -l '*atheros*'` command again, your package should be on version `0.44~bp8+1`

##### Test: 

Plug your Wi-Fi adapter into your laptop.

In the Devices menu of your guest -> USB Devices, you should be able to select the “ATHEROS USB2.0 WLAN” adapter.

Run `dmesg | grep htc` and you should see something similar to the following printed:

{linenos=off, lang=bash}
    [ 4.648701] usb 2-1: ath9k_htc: Firmware htc_9271.fw requested
    [ 4.648805] usbcore: registered new interface driver ath9k_htc
    [ 4.649951] usb 2-1: firmware: direct-loading firmware htc_9271.fw
    [ 4.966479] usb 2-1: ath9k_htc: Transferred FW: htc_9271.fw, size: 50980
    [ 5.217395] ath9k_htc 2-1:1.0: ath9k_htc: HTC initialized with 33 credits
    [ 5.860808] ath9k_htc 2-1:1.0: ath9k_htc: FW Version: 1.3

You should now be able to select the phones wireless hot-spot you want to connect to in network manager.
