## [Process](#process-and-practises)

**The fact that a WAF is in place** is often given away by simply inspecting the responses from the server side  
[https://pentestlab.wordpress.com/2013/01/13/detecting-web-application-firewalls/](https://pentestlab.wordpress.com/2013/01/13/detecting-web-application-firewalls/)

**To view all of the currently available local nmap scripts**  
[http://cyberpedia.in/nmap-scripting-engine-scanning-in-kali-linux/](http://cyberpedia.in/nmap-scripting-engine-scanning-in-kali-linux/)

**NMap has a couple of good scripts out of the box** for WAF detection  
http-waf-detect: [https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-waf-detect.html](https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-waf-detect.html)  
http-waf-fingerprint: [https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-waf-fingerprint.html](https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/http-waf-fingerprint.html)

**WAFW00F is also an excellent tool**  
[https://github.com/sandrogauci/wafw00f](https://github.com/sandrogauci/wafw00f)

**nslookup** which generally provides less information and uses its own internal libraries as opposed to the OS resolver libraries that dig uses.  
[http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/93808/dig-vs-nslookup](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/93808/dig-vs-nslookup)

**/usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directories.jbrofuzz is not great**, but it is not bad either  
[http://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/hack-like-pro-abusing-dns-for-reconnaissance-0157448/](http://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/hack-like-pro-abusing-dns-for-reconnaissance-0157448/)

**theHarvester** is a tool for gathering e-mail acconts, subdomain names, virtual hosts, open ports/ banners, and employee names from different public sources (search engines, pgp key servers)  
[https://github.com/laramies/theHarvester](https://github.com/laramies/theHarvester)

**API keys**  for recon-ng

**Linux namespaces**

**Qubes**

**Technically Qubes is not a Linux distribution**, it's closer to being a Xen distro if anything  
[https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/user-faq/#is-qubes-just-another-linux-distribution](https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/user-faq/#is-qubes-just-another-linux-distribution)

**USB stacks and drivers are sand-boxed** in their own unprivileged VM (currently experimental)  
[https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/qubes-architecture/](https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/qubes-architecture/)

**A storage domain has also been considered**

**It provides proper GUI-level** (one of the main goals) isolation  
[http://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.it/2012/09/how-is-qubes-os-different-from.html](http://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.it/2012/09/how-is-qubes-os-different-from.html)

**Along with security** as one of the primary goals of the GUI virtualisation subsystem, performance was also priority so the virtualised applications feel as if they were executed natively  
[https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/user-faq/#is-qubes-just-another-linux-distribution](https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/user-faq/#is-qubes-just-another-linux-distribution)

**Based on monolithic kernels** usually containing tens of millions of lines of code. Most of this code is reachable from untrusted applications via all sorts of APIs, making the attack surface on the kernel huge.  
[http://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.it/2012/09/how-is-qubes-os-different-from.html](http://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.it/2012/09/how-is-qubes-os-different-from.html)

**Support for Windows 8+ is in development**  
[https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/windows-appvms/](https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/windows-appvms/)

**Excellent tools for this task**. There are also many others. Many of which are included in Kali Linux  
[http://tools.kali.org/reporting-tools](http://tools.kali.org/reporting-tools)

**Dradis is included in Kali Linux** and the source code can be accessed from the dradisframework repository  
[https://github.com/dradis/dradisframework](https://github.com/dradis/dradisframework)

**There is a collection of security tools** that Dradis integrates with  
[https://github.com/dradis/dradisframework#some-of-the-features](https://github.com/dradis/dradisframework#some-of-the-features)

**If you look at the public statistics** on businesses loosing value due to being compromised regularly, the figures are staggering
