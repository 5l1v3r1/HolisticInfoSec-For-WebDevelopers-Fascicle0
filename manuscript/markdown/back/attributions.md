**The Multi-Tasking Myth** by Jeff Atwood:  
[http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-multi-tasking-myth/](http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-multi-tasking-myth/)

**What you need to do** is be aware of how much productivity is killed with each switch. Then do everything in your power to make sure your Development Team is sheltered from as much as possible. [How to Increase Software Developer Productivity](http://blog.binarymist.net/2013/03/02/how-to-increase-software-developer-productivity/#context-switching) by Kim Carter.

**The trick here** is that when you manage programmers, specifically, task switches take a really, really, really long time. [Human Task Switches Considered Harmful](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000022.html).

**If the victim's SMTP server does not perform reverse [lookups on the hostname](http://www.social-engineer.org/framework/se-tools/computer-based/social-engineer-toolkit-set/)**, an email `from` and `reply-to` fields can be successfully spoofed.

**Doppelganger Domains** An old trick brought back to light by Peter Kim's [research](http://www.wired.com/2011/09/doppelganger-domains/) involving fortune 500 companies where they intercepted 20 GB of email from miss typed addresses.  
Peter Kim discusses in "The Hacker PlayBook" about how he set-up SMTP and SSH doppelganger domains. This is an excellent book that I recommend reading.

**Other notable data-store compromises were LinkedIn** with 6.5 million user accounts compromised and 95% of the users passwords cracked in days. Why so fast?

**The function used to protect stored credentials** should balance attacker and defender verification. The defender needs an acceptable response time for verification of users’ credentials during peak use. However, the time required to map `<credential> -> <protected form>` must remain beyond threats’ hardware (GPU, FPGA) and technique (dictionary-based, brute force, etc) capabilities:
