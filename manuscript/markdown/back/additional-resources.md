# Additional Resources {#additional-resources}

* [MS Security Development Lifecycle](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/SDL/process/design.aspx) is actually pretty good.
* Although not specifically referred to in this model, the [Building Security In Maturity Model (BSIMM)](https://www.bsimm.com/online/) resources are very helpful. They don't really tell you how to implement secure software, but they do provide scales to measure the maturity of your development processes on many dimensions.
