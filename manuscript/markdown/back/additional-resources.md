* [MS Security Development Lifecycle](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/SDL/process/design.aspx) is actually pretty good.
* Although not specifically referred to in this model, the [Building Security In Maturity Model (BSIMM)](https://www.bsimm.com/online/) resources are very helpful. They don't really tell you how to implement secure software, but they do provide scales to measure the maturity of your development processes on many dimensions.

## [People](#people)

**Morale, Productivity and Engagement Killers**: An excellent resource around motivation can be found in Chapter 11 of Steve McConnell's excellent "Rapid Development" book.

**Presentation I performed at AgileNZ 2014** around [increasing developer productivity](https://speakerdeck.com/binarymist/how-to-increase-software-developer-productivity)

[**Social Engineer**](http://www.social-engineer.org/) website has a plethora of excellent resources.

The following books have been influential for me and the content from the People chapter should reflect that. They are very insightful and well worth the investment.

* The Social Engineers Playbook: A Practical Guide to Pretexting by Jeremiah Talamantes
* Social Engineering: The Art of Human Hacking by Christopher Hadnagy
* The Art Of Deception by Kevin Mitnick
* Chapter 10 of Beyond Fear by Bruce Schneier
* Gray Hat Hacking The Ethical Hacker's Handbook
