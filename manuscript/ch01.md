## Starting with the 30,000' view

![30,000' view](assets/img/30000View.gif)

This modelling process should be performed by a collection of the following people:
 1. Deeply technical (software expert (developer/engineer)). I specifically don't mention tester(s) here, as testing is the job of the developer. The developer is responsible for delivering high quality working code every Sprint.
 2. Network expert(s)
 3. Domain expert(s) 
 4. The person solely responsible for the project or product being delivered
 5. Person(s) with security specialisations in the areas involved in the finished product. Remember you need to step back in order for your peripheral vision to kick in.

Having this process performed by a team brings out the best in everyone. There are of course times when it's more effective to break out and work alone for a period of time.

Assets will often emerge as you progress through the following steps.

 I also like to abstract things a bit here and think about some of the entities that could be risky to the target business.

 Then think about some of the relationships the target business depends on...  
How they could be leaking IP.

 * Risk = Likelihood * Impact
* Just as you would with any development features, create Product Backlog Items (PBI's) and order based on highest scoring risks.

### 4. SSM Risks that Solution Causes

This is really dependent on the solution(s) you discover.

* Make sure before you test that you have written permission for all the areas that you're about to test, documenting what could possibly go wrong.
* Make sure you have backups and that they work.
* Complacency?
* Spending too much on technological solutions and ignoring the fact that the person on the front desk can easily be tricked to reveal information an attacker needs or lower the defences of a computer system. See the section on [People](#people).

### 5. SSM Costs and Trade-offs
I'm not here to do the work for you, but rather to help you do it.

This is really dependent on the solution(s) you discover.
